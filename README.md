# Coursera_Getting-CleaningData_CourseProject
### The data for the project was obtained from the following link

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The file should be extracted and saved in the working directory before running the R script

### The following steps were coded in the R script called run_analysis.R:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### The activity labels used have been described in CodeBook.md

### The tidy data set obtained after performing the given steps is included in the file secTidySet.txt
